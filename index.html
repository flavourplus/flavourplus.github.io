        <h2 class="simple-heading">Our Product and Potential</h2>
        <p class="lead">
            We have always been located in North-Western Sydney, maintaining easy access to all major city centres,
            customers and markets.
            Our produce has always been grown on our 5 acre property which consists of 7500m&sup2; of fully automated
            greenhouses, with immediate access and plans to develop another 3500m&sup2; as part of our future projected
            business plan.
            The property has a 220m&sup2; packing shed with plenty of room and potential for future needs.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            Our operations are specifically designed to provide large amounts of produce, and in the last ferw years
            this has mainly been continental parsley.
            We currently produce anywhere between 1000-1200 dozen per week between mid-October to mid-June and about
            400-500 dozen per week between mid-June to mid-October.
            The production is currently at approximately 44000 dozen per year and can easily increase by around 30% to
            realise the properties full potential.
